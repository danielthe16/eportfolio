<h1>Screenprint Project</h1> 
<h3>Welcome to my website</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Daniel Apprekuh and I am  a student in Mr. Sinusus's New Media and Tech class. In New Media, we build, code, and edit stuff. Recently we started a new project where we will be screen printing. On this website, I will be telling you all about my thinking process, the steps, and the challenges of this project.
</p>

<h3>Brainstorming and Taking the Picture</h3>
<p>The first step of the screen printing process was to brainstorm what image we would make, what message it was supposed to send, and what audience it was meant for. Also, the image is supposed to be a picture of you posing or doing something that would later be edited to help convey your message. After Brainstorming I decided to make a picture that would encourage people and the audience was everyone who saw it. I decided I would take a picture of me running and then edit and add text saying to keep improving to make it look encouraging. What inspired me for this was the saying keep running towards your goals, but during the picture-taking process, it was hard to get the running picture that I envisioned so I decided to take a picture of me flexing my arms and it was inspired by seeing people at the gym work hard to get bigger, stronger, muscular arms. I took the shot with a medium shot, a narrow depth of field, a grain of 100, shutters of 1/1000, and an aperture of F1,4. I decided to use that for my message and edit. </p>

<h3>Editing the Picture</h3>
<p> The next step was editing the picture. Since we were new to Adobe Illustrator we practiced using the tools by doing morning pictionary and practices. Some of the tools that we learned that helped me edit the picture were the eraser tool, text tool, and the paint bucket tool. I used the eraser to get rid of my background and then I used the paint bucket tool to make the background black and make the picture of me flexing white. Then lastly I wrote 5 times going down Keep Improving on the side of me flexing. I think that by the end I had 3 layers. Lastly, we used the dimensions tool to get the right measurements for the picture to see how it would fit into the frame.

<h3> Making the Frame and Adding Fabric</h3>
<p>  Next we started making our frame. We measured the length and width of our frame on a long piece of wood based on the size of our image. Then we used the saw cutter to cut the width and length we measured on the piece of wood into two pieces one was the length the other was the width. Then I got a new long piece of wood and used the length and width of the wood I previously cut to measure the new long piece of wood. After getting my 4 pieces of wood 2 lengths, and 2 widths I needed to put them together. I used gorilla glue on the diagonally cut sides of the wood smushed them and then stapled them together to keep them still and left it to dry. Next class I measured and cut the fabric that I would be using for the screen based on the size of my frame. Stapling the fabric requires 2 people because you need to make sure that the fabric is stapled on tight so one person pulls the fabric and the other staples. I worked with people at my table and tables close to mine to staple my fabric and other people's fabric. After finishing the frame and fabric it was time to print the image that I made. </P>

<h3> Finshing Frame</h3>
<p> After finishing the frame it was time to print out my image on stencil. Before we print we need to import the image into an app called Silhouette. I then measure the stencil according to my image. Then put it on a sticky big paper ( I don’t know what it is called ) and insert it into the printer. I had to connect the computer I had Silhouette opened to the printer and then send the image to the printer. After it was done printing/cutting, I removed the cut-outs that the printer made. Now to finish the frame I then iron the image onto the fabric attached to the frame. I have to make sure I put the protective fabric on top of my image so it doesn’t get damaged. Now when the image has stuck to the fabric you take out the protective cover and your frame is done.

<h3> Screenprinting </h3>
<p> Lastly, it was time to screenprint, I attached the frame to something at the edge of the table that allowed me to raise it up and down. I put a piece of paper below the frame and then lowered it. After that, I put paint on the side of the fabric that the image was on and spread it all over the image. I did this on paper and fabric. I couldn’t do the box cause I ran out of time.

<h3> 21st Century Skills </h3>
<p> The 21st-century competency that I used the most in this project was creativity and innovation. I feel like I  “Demonstrates openness to divergent approaches and recognizes setbacks as a valuable part of the innovation process.” as said in the criteria because I was open to not adding extra stuff like everyone else and when I couldn't get the pose that I originally envisioned I decided to go with something else and that worked even better.

<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p> What I enjoyed most about this project was printing the stencil and ironing. Some changes I made were changing what pose and picture I was going to take in the beginning to convey my message of keep improving and editing. An obstacle that I faced during this project was when I was ironing and I kept getting air bubbles, but as I kept Ironing they slowly went away. Also, I couldn’t have done this without the help of others while glowing the wood and stapling and tightening the fabric and stapling. I might make screen prints on shirts in the future thanks to this project.
